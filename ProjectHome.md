## **Mission** ##

To provide a useful, reliable, and well performing framework for handling collections of objects in Actionscript 3.

## **Overview** ##

Before we started working on this we had a pretty good idea of the direction we wanted to go.  Above all we wanted to make it useful and reliable, for obvious reasons.  Our second goal was to make it perform well, although we already knew that it would not perform as well as an Array.  We want to see exactly how much of a performance hit, and in what areas, having this framework would make.
